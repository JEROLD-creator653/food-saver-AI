## 🧩 How FoodSaver AI Works

### 1. Food Listing

Users upload surplus food info (type, quantity, expiry, pickup location).

### 2. AI Assistance

AI helps improve listing quality with suggestions like:

* Better food categorization
* Expiry detection
* Recommended serving size
* Donation priority scoring

### 3. Matching & Discovery

Nearby users and volunteers get notified of available donations.

### 4. Pickup & Delivery

Volunteers or recipients coordinate to complete the exchange.
